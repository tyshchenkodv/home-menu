# Architecture

## System context

Home Menu is a static single-page application. GitHub Pages serves HTML,
JavaScript, and CSS. The browser communicates directly with Firebase
Authentication and Cloud Firestore, which form the serverless backend.

    Repo["Public GitHub repository"] --> Actions["GitHub Actions"]
    Actions --> Pages["GitHub Pages"]
    Actions --> Deploy["Rules and indexes deployment"]
```

There is no custom runtime server, Cloud Function, or scheduler in the MVP.

## Technology decisions

- React with strict TypeScript
- Vite
- Material UI with a mobile-first theme
- React Router `HashRouter`
- `i18next` and `react-i18next`
- Firebase modular Web SDK
- React Context only for authentication and authorization state
- typed Firestore hooks using `onSnapshot`
- pure TypeScript domain functions

## Agent workflow and documentation architecture

Repository automation follows the root `AGENTS.md` router. Every task starts
with `using-superpowers` and `home-menu-project`; substantial work then moves
through discovery, `brainstorming`, `grill-me`, a repository SPEC, an approved
PLAN, implementation, review, verification, and current documentation updates.

Substantial work includes new features, user-visible workflows, behavior or
business-rule changes, architecture decisions, Firebase schema, Rules, index,
transaction, auth, privacy, deployment, i18n, or multi-layer changes. Minimal
typo fixes, formatting-only edits, behavior-preserving cleanup, documentation
synchronization, and work already covered by an active approved plan do not
need a new SPEC or PLAN.

Historical planning artifacts live under
`docs/specifications/<slug>/{SPEC.md,PLAN.md}` and are immutable after
approval. They document the decision at the time it was approved. Current
system behavior belongs in this `docs/` tree. If implementation or future
follow-up work materially changes approved requirements, create a new linked
specification instead of rewriting the old one.

The current documentation may be split into domain-focused files when a topic
becomes too large to navigate. Prefer indexes and links over duplicated rules:
one current document should own each architectural decision.

## Layering

### Presentation

Pages and Material UI components:

- render loading, empty, error, and ready states;
- collect and validate input;
- resolve translation keys;
- call application hooks and commands;
- never issue raw Firestore queries.

### Application

Hooks and use cases:

- subscribe to dishes, ingredients, batches, settings, and orders;
- combine snapshots into view models;
- orchestrate forms and dialogs;
- invoke domain validators;
- invoke infrastructure transactions;
- map domain errors to translation keys.

### Domain

Pure functions without React or Firebase dependencies:

- `evaluateDishAvailability`;
- `canCookStandardBatch`;
- `convertToBaseUnit`;
- `allocateReadyBatchesFifo`;
- `canTransitionOrder`;
- `canCancelOrder`;
- `deriveEffectiveOrderStatus`;
- prepared-batch conservation validators.

### Infrastructure

- Firebase initialization;
- Firestore converters and queries;
- transaction implementations;
- Authentication adapter;
- `Timestamp` conversion;
- error-code normalization.

Features may import domain, infrastructure, and shared modules. Domain modules
must not import React, Firebase, Material UI, or i18next.

## State and real-time synchronization

`AuthContext` stores only:

- the Firebase Auth user;
- the loaded `users/{uid}` profile;
- the role;
- authentication and authorization state.

Firestore data is not copied into Redux or another global store. Feature hooks
own narrowly scoped subscriptions and unsubscribe on unmount. Route-level
providers may share a subscription where profiling demonstrates duplicate
reads.

## Internationalization

`i18next` is initialized before the application renders:

- supported languages: `uk`, `en`;
- default language: `uk`;
- fallback language: `en`;
- preference storage: browser `localStorage`;
- namespace strategy: start with one `translation` namespace and split by
  feature only when files become difficult to maintain.

Rules:

- no user-facing literal strings in TSX;
- status labels and validation errors use translation keys;
- both locale files must contain the same key set;
- domain and persistence values remain language-neutral enum strings;
- user-created names and descriptions are stored as entered and are not
  automatically translated.

## Routes

`HashRouter` avoids a GitHub Pages SPA fallback:

```text
/#/login
/#/               (RootRedirect)
/#/menu
/#/orders
/#/settings
/#/admin
/#/admin/orders
/#/admin/batches
/#/admin/dishes
/#/admin/inventory
/#/admin/inventory/history
```

`/login` is the only ungated route. Every other route is nested under a
single layout route, `<RequireActiveProfile><AppShell /></RequireActiveProfile>`
(`src/app/router.tsx`), so an authenticated-and-active profile is required
before any in-app screen renders; `RequireActiveProfile`
(`src/features/auth/RequireActiveProfile.tsx`) does not check role.
`/admin/*` routes are additionally wrapped in `RequireAdmin`. Route guards are
a UX measure; Firestore Rules enforce the actual authorization boundary.

`AppShell` (`src/shared/components/AppShell/`) is the layout route's element:
it renders `AppHeader`, role-aware responsive navigation (`AppNavDrawer` at
the `md` breakpoint and above, `AppNavBottom` below it), and the routed
`<Outlet/>`. `AppHeader` no longer renders globally from
`app/providers/AppProviders.tsx`; it renders only inside `AppShell`, so
`/login` has no header, navigation, or switcher chrome.

The index route (`/`) renders `RootRedirect` (`src/app/RootRedirect.tsx`),
which reads `useAuth()` and navigates an `admin` profile to `/admin` and a
`user` profile to `/menu`, showing a loading placeholder while auth status is
still resolving. `LoginPage` uses the same admin→`/admin`, user→`/menu`
redirect target for an already-active profile, so the two entry points land
consistently.

`AuthStatus` (`src/features/auth/authContextValue.ts`) is
`'loading' | 'authenticated' | 'unauthenticated' | 'error'`. `AuthContext`
sets `'error'` (not `'authenticated'`) when the `users/{uid}` profile read
itself rejects (offline, `permission-denied`, aborted) and logs the failure
via `import.meta.env.DEV`-gated `console.error` — development only, no PII
beyond the Firebase error code/message. A missing document still resolves to
`'authenticated'` with `profile: null`, which the route guards render as
access-denied. `RequireActiveProfile` renders a distinct, retryable error
state (`StatePlaceholder` `confused` + retry) for `status === 'error'`,
keeping "profile not provisioned" and "profile failed to load" visually and
semantically separate.

## Atomic operations

Use `runTransaction` whenever one action changes multiple documents:

- reserve prepared portions;
- cancel a prepared-food reservation;
- complete cooking;
- add or correct ingredient stock;
- discard a prepared batch;
- normalize consumed reservations.

A transaction re-reads current documents, validates invariants, and then writes.
Disabling a submit button improves UX but is not the concurrency guarantee.

All client writes that carry an audit timestamp (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) use
Firestore's `serverTimestamp()` rather than a client-generated `Date`/
`Timestamp.now()`, across every service in
`src/infrastructure/firebase/services/*`. This is required, not just
convention: Security Rules validate those fields against `request.time` (see
`docs/06-auth-and-security.md`), so a client-forged value is rejected.
Fields that represent a chosen instant rather than "now" (`scheduledFor`,
`preparedAt`, `expiresAt`) are unaffected and stay client-supplied.

## Time-based state without a scheduler

An order stores `scheduledFor`. If it has not been cancelled and
`scheduledFor <= now`, the client derives an effective `consumed` state even if
the persisted state has not yet been normalized.

This eventual consistency does not expose portions to double booking because
they leave `availableQuantity` at reservation time. A later administrator view
or mutation may normalize the persisted order and batch counters.

## Error handling

- Domain failures have stable codes such as `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`,
  `ORDER_ALREADY_CHANGED`, and `FORBIDDEN_TRANSITION`.
- Presentation maps codes to i18n keys.
- Permission failures must not appear as empty lists.
- A failed transaction must not leave partial updates.
- Raw technical details are logged only in development.
